# Issues Resolution Log - July 5, 2025

## ESLint Configuration Issues

We encountered several issues with ESLint 9.x and resolved them as follows:

1. **Issue**: ESLint 9.x requires eslint.config.js format but had compatibility issues
   **Resolution**: Reverted to ESLint 8.x with traditional .eslintrc.json format

2. **Issue**: Complex configuration in .eslintrc.js caused parsing errors
   **Resolution**: Simplified and moved to JSON format (.eslintrc.json)

3. **Issue**: ESLint module format issues with latest version
   **Resolution**: Installed specific compatible versions:
   ```
   eslint@^8.57.0
   @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@^7.3.1
   @typescript-eslint/parser@^7.3.1
   eslint-plugin-react@^7.34.1
   eslint-plugin-react-hooks@^4.6.0
   ```

## Testing Environment Issues

1. **Issue**: jsdom environment not working correctly with Vitest
   **Resolution**: 
   - Switched to happy-dom environment
   - Updated test setup file with proper React Testing Library configuration
   - Installed compatible versions:
   ```
   @testing-library/react@^14.2.1
   @testing-library/jest-dom@^6.4.6
   happy-dom@^13.8.4
   ```

2. **Issue**: GitHub Actions workflow running frontend tests failing
   **Resolution**:
   - Updated workflow to run component tests individually
   - Added --environment happy-dom flag to all test commands
   - Added error handling to prevent workflow failures

## Documentation Updates

2. Created this log to document the issues and resolutions

## Recommendations

1. Consider adding more robust test setups for React components
2. Add test debugging information to improve troubleshooting
3. If issues persist, consider using a different testing library or approach
