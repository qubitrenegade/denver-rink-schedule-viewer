# Development Infrastructure Updates

This document outlines the improvements made to the development and CI/CD infrastructure of the Denver Rink Schedule Viewer project.

## ESLint Migration - July 5, 2025

TSLint has been replaced with ESLint for better maintenance and TypeScript support:

- ✅ Migrated from deprecated TSLint to ESLint
- ✅ Added React and TypeScript specific rules
- ✅ Added lint scripts to package.json
- ✅ Removed tslint.json and tslint dependency

See `docs/eslint-migration.md` for details.

## CI/CD Improvements - July 5, 2025

The GitHub Actions workflows have been significantly enhanced:

### PR Checks Workflow
- ✅ Added dependency caching for faster runs
- ✅ Added ESLint linting step
- ✅ Added test coverage reporting
- ✅ Split tests into parallel shards (frontend, scrapers, utils, api)
- ✅ Added artifact storage for test results
- ✅ Added PR comment with test results
- ✅ Added aggregated test results summary

### Benchmarks Workflow
- ✅ Added performance benchmarking workflow
- ✅ Created example benchmarks for filtering operations
- ✅ Added benchmark artifact storage
- ✅ Added PR comments with benchmark results

### Scheduled Tests Workflow
- ✅ Added daily testing of scrapers
- ✅ Added automatic issue creation for scraper failures
- ✅ Configured to detect website structure changes

### Dependency Management
- ✅ Added Dependabot configuration
- ✅ Configured weekly updates for npm and GitHub Actions
- ✅ Set up sensible grouping of dependencies

## Branch Protection

A documentation file has been created with recommendations for GitHub branch protection rules:

- Required status checks before merging
- Pull request reviews requirement
- Conversation resolution requirement

See `docs/branch-protection.md` for details.

## Next Steps

1. **Custom ESLint Rules**: Fine-tune ESLint rules to match team coding standards
2. **Prettier Integration**: Consider adding Prettier for code formatting
3. **Code Coverage Goals**: Set minimum coverage thresholds
4. **Additional Benchmarks**: Add more performance benchmarks for critical operations
