# Implementation Roadmap

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1: Core Refactoring (Week 1)
**Goal: Reduce complexity and improve maintainability**

### Day 1-2: App.tsx Decomposition
- [ ] Extract `useEventData` custom hook from App.tsx
- [ ] Extract `useUrlState` custom hook 
- [ ] Extract `useEventFiltering` custom hook
- [ ] Create `EventDataProvider` and `FilterProvider` contexts
- [ ] Reduce App.tsx from 700+ lines to ~50 lines

**Expected Impact:** 80% reduction in App.tsx complexity

### Day 3-4: Scraper Base Class Enhancement
- [ ] Add shared timezone utilities to BaseScraper
- [ ] Add consistent logging methods
- [ ] Add retry logic and better error handling
- [ ] Create standardized event validation

**Expected Impact:** 50% reduction in scraper code duplication

### Day 5: Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Add `useMemo` to expensive filtering operations
- [ ] Add `useCallback` to event handlers
- [ ] Add `React.memo` to pure components (EventCard, etc.)

**Expected Impact:** 30-40% improvement in render performance

## ðŸ”§ Phase 2: Component Refactoring (Week 2)
**Goal: Better component organization and reusability**

### Day 1-3: FilterControls Breakdown
- [ ] Create `FilterSection` wrapper component
- [ ] Extract `DateFilter` component
- [ ] Extract `TimeFilter` component  
- [ ] Extract `CategoryFilter` component
- [ ] Extract `RinkFilter` component
- [ ] Create reusable `FilterModeSelector` component

**Expected Impact:** 75% reduction in FilterControls.tsx complexity

### Day 4-5: Type System Improvements
- [ ] Replace magic strings with const assertions
- [ ] Remove all `any` types from scrapers
- [ ] Add proper return type annotations
- [ ] Create discriminated unions for state management
- [ ] Add generic utility types for forms

**Expected Impact:** Eliminate runtime type errors, better DX

## ðŸš€ Phase 3: Code Quality & Cleanup (Week 3)
**Goal: Remove technical debt and improve developer experience**

### Day 1-2: Dead Code Removal
- [ ] Remove debug/test scripts from production
- [ ] Clean up commented code in rinkConfig.ts
- [ ] Remove unused environment variables
- [ ] Audit and remove unused dependencies

### Day 3-4: Scraper Standardization  
- [ ] Migrate all scrapers to use enhanced BaseScraper
- [ ] Standardize error handling across scrapers
- [ ] Add consistent validation to all scrapers
- [ ] Create shared categorization logic

### Day 5: Developer Tools
- [ ] Add development-only debug tools
- [ ] Improve error messages with context
- [ ] Add bundle analysis setup
- [ ] Create JSDoc documentation for complex functions

## ðŸ“Š Phase 4: Advanced Optimizations (Week 4)
**Goal: Performance and bundle optimization**

### Day 1-2: Bundle Optimization
- [ ] Implement code splitting for large components
- [ ] Add lazy loading for non-critical components  
- [ ] Optimize chunk sizes
- [ ] Add bundle analysis to CI/CD

### Day 3-4: Data Flow Optimization
- [ ] Implement Map-based lookups for O(1) performance
- [ ] Pre-process data once when loaded
- [ ] Cache expensive computations
- [ ] Add data invalidation strategies

### Day 5: Monitoring & Analytics
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Track bundle size in CI
- [ ] Add error tracking for production
- [ ] Create development performance dashboard

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

### Code Quality Metrics
- [ ] Reduce App.tsx from 700+ lines to <100 lines
- [ ] Reduce FilterControls.tsx from 300+ lines to <100 lines  
- [ ] Eliminate all `any` types (currently ~20 instances)
- [ ] Reduce scraper code duplication by 50%

### Performance Metrics
- [ ] First Contentful Paint: <1.5s (target)
- [ ] Time to Interactive: <3s (target)
- [ ] Bundle size: <500KB gzipped (target)
- [ ] Component render time: <16ms average

### Developer Experience Metrics
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode: 100% compliance
- [ ] Test coverage: >80% for utilities
- [ ] Build time: <30s (target)
- [ ] Hot reload time: <2s (target)

## ðŸš¨ Risk Mitigation

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Test each phase incrementally
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility during refactor
- [ ] Use feature flags for major changes
- [ ] Keep old implementations during transition

### Rollback Plan
- [ ] Create git tags before each phase
- [ ] Document breaking changes
- [ ] Maintain CI/CD stability
- [ ] Keep monitoring for regressions

## ðŸ“… Timeline Summary

**Week 1:** Core architecture improvements (biggest impact)
**Week 2:** Component organization (better maintainability)  
**Week 3:** Code quality cleanup (reduced technical debt)
**Week 4:** Performance optimization (better user experience)
