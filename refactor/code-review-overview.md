# Code Review: Denver Rink Schedule Viewer

## Overall Assessment

The project is well-structured with good separation of concerns between data scraping, frontend display, and CI/CD automation. However, there are several opportunities for simplification and cleanup.

## Architecture Strengths

âœ… **Good separation of concerns**
- Scrapers are modular and isolated
- Frontend is cleanly separated from data fetching
- Individual facility data files provide good scalability

âœ… **Robust error handling**
- Individual facility metadata tracking
- Graceful degradation when some facilities fail

âœ… **Well-designed CI/CD**
- Distributed scraping across multiple workflows
- Proper error handling in GitHub Actions

## Major Areas for Improvement

### 1. App.tsx Complexity ðŸ”´
- **700+ line component** - needs decomposition
- **10+ useState hooks** - consider useReducer or context
- **Complex filtering logic** - should be extracted to custom hooks
- **Large useEffect blocks** - should be broken down

### 2. Code Duplication ðŸŸ¡
- Similar patterns across scrapers without shared utilities
- Repeated timezone conversion logic
- Duplicated form validation patterns

### 3. TypeScript Usage ðŸŸ¡
- Some `any` types that could be properly typed
- Missing return type annotations in some functions
- Could leverage more advanced TS features for better DX

### 4. Performance Concerns ðŸŸ¡
- Filtering logic runs on every render
- Large state objects being recreated frequently
- Could benefit from useMemo/useCallback optimization

## Priority Recommendations

1. **Decompose App.tsx** - Extract custom hooks and smaller components
2. **Create shared utilities** - For timezone handling, date parsing, and common scraper patterns
3. **Optimize filtering logic** - Move to custom hooks with proper memoization
4. **Improve error boundaries** - More granular error handling
5. **Consolidate scraper patterns** - More shared functionality in base scraper
